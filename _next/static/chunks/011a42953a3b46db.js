He is a true team player: working with product and UX to design the right changes; consulting with other developers and providing documentation to ensure they are following best implementation practices and agreed-upon methods; working with QA to ensure chagnes are fully tested and automation has what they need; and reviewing end user documenation.\n\nRichard is a leader, and as an architect is often called on to advise on the right technical chagnes to make. He is diligent about documenting his work, which allows other engineers to more easily come on board. He is always willing to provide guidance and input to others in development.\n\nRichard is so good that he's in the sometimes unenviable position of being the go-to person to fix any problem.
